                    <p><em>Full Stack Developer Bootcamp from </em><strong>Sep to Dec '21'</strong></p>
                    <p>With a team of 6 people we developed an ad portal in 2 weeks. We worked with the SCRUM methodology (reduced to just 2 weeks due to the timing of the course)and using the Git control system. We have developed our portal working mainly with PHP Taking advantage of the Laravel framework some of its packages such as Fortify for user authentication or Scout for the fulltext research. The Dropzone.js library to allow the user to insert images. MySQL as a database and exploited the one-to-many relationship between categories and ads. Implemented the resize of the image as an asynchronous request to allow the portal to be performing. And the artificial intelligence of the Google VisionAPI to filter and tag the contents of the photos of the ads on our portal. During the bootcamp I learned: HTML5 & CSS3, Javascript, NodeJs, Bootstrap, PHP with Laravel Framework, MySql with ELOQUENT, SCRUM and Agile Methodologies.</p>

                    <p>
                        I have been a football referee because sport has always been my passion. It was a wonderful experience that shaped my character a lot. I was a boy of just 20 years and I had to manage and enforce the rules for 22 players on the field, plus as many members on the benches of the two teams. Make split-second decisions and demonstrate firmness and confidence. Often managing the pressure of hundreds of fans who criticized my choices from the stands. In soccer it is a classic.</p>

                        Bathhouse in the municipality of Fiumicino where I started working bringing sunbeds. After a season I started working as a cashier. The following years I took care of the cash department. The training of new staff, the orders of the various suppliers (bar, restaurant) and the management of the cash system and its optimization over the seasons. Making the operator's work fast and intuitive and guaranteeing the customer short waiting times. The facility had around 20-25 employees and a beach that accommodated from 1000 people a day, to over 4000 at the weekend.</p>
